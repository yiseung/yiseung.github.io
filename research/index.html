		<h1>How TechSmith Builds Software</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p class="body">
			<span class="tab"></span>TechSmith is a software company founded by William Hamilton in 1987, and its headquarters are located in Okemos, Michigan. The company is passionate for helping individuals learn with visual tools and focuses on developing screen capture and recording software such as Camtasia, Snagit, and many others.
		</p>
		<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
		<p class="body">
			<span class="tab"></span>TechSmith's goal when it comes to developing a program is to build software that could be used by as many users as possible, and that includes making sure that the program runs on different platforms. The company concentrates mainly on two operating systems, Windows and Mac OS. The core of all code is written in C++ for best performance and is shared between different operating systems. On Windows, they started with C++ and MFC for initial development. Newer technologies such as C# and WPF were taken into account later as technology advanced.  On the other hand, Objective-C with Cocoa is mainly used for Mac development with the C++ core code supporting on the backend.
		</p>
		<h2>Servers</h2>
		<p class="body">
			<span class="tab"></span>All of their code resides on TechSmith's dozens of web servers and database services. In general, the company runs a Windows server with IIS and Microsoft SQL respectively. Those servers are virtual, meaning that they are running on VMware and HP host machines with NetApp storage.
		</p>
		<h2>Deployment and Security</h2>
		<p class="body">
			<span class="tab"></span>Firewalls, network isolation, access control, and least-privilege-principle are evaluated for each deployment.
		</p>
		<h2>Sources and Help</h2>
			<p class="body">
				<span class="tab"></span>I used <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/about.html">TechSmith's offical website</a> and <a href="http://blogs.techsmith.com/inside-techsmith/dev-corner-what-programming/">TechSmith's blog</a> to base this research off of. Special thanks to Justin Fila, a software developer at TechSmith, who provided insight answers to the author's questions.
